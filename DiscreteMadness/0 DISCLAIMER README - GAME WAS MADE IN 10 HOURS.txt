This game was created in one night, in 10 hours. We were up very late; this style of coding
doesn't represent our professional abilities, instead it represents our ability to deliver a
prototype application in a very short time span, under pressure, and under a lack of sleep.
Please do not mis-judge my programming abilities based on this project alone.

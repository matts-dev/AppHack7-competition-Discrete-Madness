# AppHack7-competition-Discrete-Madness
This game was created during an all-night programming competition in Spring 2016.
It depicts the player facing professor Swanson, a professor infamous for giving difficult discrete exams and
quizzes such as binary speed conversions. This game was made as a parody of those speed quizzes. 
The objective is to analyze the binary that the professor shoots at the player,
then aim the mouse and fire back the appropriate decimal conversion. 
The game is made using the JSFML libraries.
In order to compile this project, you will need to download JSFML and configure it in your project settings as
an external jar/library file. 

JSFML version: jsfml-test-jul31_2013


DISCLAIMER:
This game was created in one night, in 10 hours. We were up very late; this style of coding
doesn't represent our professional abilities, instead it represents our ability to deliver a
prototype application in a very short time span, under pressure, and under a lack of sleep.
Please do not mis-judge my programming abilities based on this project alone.
